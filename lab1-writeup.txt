Design Decisions
There is no major design decisions in this lab that is not specified in lab
instructions.

API Changes
None, but I modified AbstractDbFileIterator's internals so that the iterator
will fail when calling next() with the iterator unopened/closed.

Missing or Incomplete Elements
I may be missing a few null checks, but I have tried my best to make sure
that null cases are handled.

Hours Spent
Around 9? Didn't really keep count.

Difficult/confusing Parts
Sometimes the documentation isn't very clear on what a function should do,
so I have to look at other functions/tests calling that function to figure
the functionality out myself. In the case of Tuple.resetTupleDesc, the
function is not called by others so I have to guess.
