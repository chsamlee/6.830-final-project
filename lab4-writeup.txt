Design decisions

I implemented page-level locking granularity because tuple-level locking has substantial overhead and page-level locking should not affect concurrency too much since each page only has at most 1024 tuples.

For deadlock detection, I used dependency graphs for the following reason
- We can immediately determine if there is a deadlock
- Timeouts require additional threads and the system can become very complex

For deadlock resolution, I chose aborting yourself.
